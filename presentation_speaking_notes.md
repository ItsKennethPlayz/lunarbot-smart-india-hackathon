## **COMMON Q&A PREPARATION**

### **Q: How does this differ from existing lunar robots?**
**A:** "Existing systems are primarily remote-controlled with limited autonomy. Our systems make intelligent decisions independently, coordinate with other robots, and predict failures before they happen. We're moving from teleoperation to true autonomy."

### **Q: What about communication delays?**
**A:** "That's exactly why autonomy is crucial. Our systems are designed to operate independently for extended periods, making optimal decisions locally while coordinating with Earth during communication windows."

### **Q: How do you ensure safety in such critical applications?**
**A:** "We use multiple layers of safety: formal verification of critical algorithms, Byzantine fault tolerance for coordination, memory-safe programming languages, and extensive testing including chaos engineering."

### **Q: What's your commercialization strategy?**
**A:** "We're pursuing a dual path: academic publication for research impact and technology licensing for commercial applications. The market need is immediate with NASA Artemis and commercial lunar missions."

### **Q: How realistic is the timeline for implementation?**
**A:** "Our 16-week research program produces technology ready for further development. Integration with real missions would require additional engineering, but our core algorithms and architectures are mission-ready."
